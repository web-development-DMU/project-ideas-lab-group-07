    <h1>Praisy Petiamboh - Pekeleke</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Praisy and im in year 2 of university studying Software Engineering. Surprisingly I don't have a favourite colour but i love neutrals. I LOVE makeup and watching football and ice hockey.
        I don't have much background in coding or building web applications, but i'm learning. I try my best and i've done well so far!
    </p>
    <p>
        In this module, I am looking forward to learning more about web development and building a project that can be used by others. I am excited to gain more knowldge and learn new skills as well as help out in my team in creating something useful and practical! I am hoping to get better at coding  whilst also working on and improving my web development skills!
