    <h3>Application ideas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A web application for grad students to use the libary. </li>
        <li> The Grad Archive is a web-based university library management system designed to modernise how students interact with library services. The idea is to allow students to search for books, check availability, and reserve or borrow items online before visiting the physical library. This reduces queues, saves time, and improves access to learning resources.

The system also helps librarians manage the catalogue digitally by adding, updating, or removing books and tracking borrowing records automatically. By combining a website interface with a database, the application provides real-time information, improves organisation, and creates a more efficient and user-friendly library experience. </li>
