        <h1>Bhavya Chauhan</h1>
        <p>
            I am <strong>Bhavya Chauhan</strong>, a second-year CS student just trying to figure out web things.
            I'm here to learn, experiment, and maybe build something that people actually find useful.
            Expect some fun, some chaos, but also some solid code (hopefully).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this module, I'm excited to get hands-on with web development, try new tech,
            and see how much I can improve my coding skills.
            I'm all about exploring, creating, and learning while keeping things low-stress and practical.
        </p>

            <li>A micro-blogging app where users share memes, life updates, or quick tips with friends.</li>
            <li>A playlist collab app where friends vote on songs in real time and create group vibes.</li>
