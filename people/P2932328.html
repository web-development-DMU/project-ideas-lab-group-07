    <h1>Racha's experience</h1>

I am new to web development and have very little experience with HTML,
CSS, or JavaScript. I am taking this module to learn the basics of how
websites are built and to gain practical skills in web development.

    i am really excited!
    I am hoping to learn the fundamentals of web development in this module,
        including how to structure web pages using HTML, style them with CSS,
        and add basic interactivity using JavaScript.
