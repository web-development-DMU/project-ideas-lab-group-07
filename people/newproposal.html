            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
               Our idea is to design a web application for tours and travels to manage 
               tours, packages, and customer bookings.
               This system allows customers to search available tours, view detailed 
               information, and submit booking requests through the website. 
               Admin can manage tour listings, update information, and monitor 
               customer bookings through a structured management interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                This application needs an admin system so that tours and packages 
                can be added, deleted, and updated.
            </p>
