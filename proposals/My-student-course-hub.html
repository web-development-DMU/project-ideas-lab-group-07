            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This weather app does exactly what it says on its title.
                Shows the users the weather and gives out a outfit recommendation going off of the weather.
                Users can browse through days of the current week and check out the weather.
                They will be able to plan and get an idea of what their outfit should be depending on what it recommends.

                It will need an administrator who checks the website daily and updates it daily.
