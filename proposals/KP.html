            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                 So, our idea is to design a web application for Real Estate, to 
               manage viewing properties, filter prices, location and customer bookings etc.
               This system allows customers to search available properties, view detail information 
               and submit booking request through this website. Admin can manage propertie listings,
               update information and monitor customer bookings through a structured management
               interface. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This application needs admin system so that they can add, 
               delete and update the properties, prices, details and locations information.
            </p>
